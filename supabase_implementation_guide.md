## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Create the Database Structure

```bash
# Run the main structure file
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f supabase_database_structure.sql
```

### 2. Configure Storage Buckets

```sql
-- Execute these commands in the Supabase SQL editor

-- Profile images bucket (public)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('profile-images', 'profile-images', true);

-- Shop images bucket (public)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('shop-images', 'shop-images', true);

-- Service images bucket (public)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('service-images', 'service-images', true);

-- Review images bucket (public)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('review-images', 'review-images', true);

-- Post images bucket (public)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('post-images', 'post-images', true);

-- Business documents bucket (private)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('business-documents', 'business-documents', false);
```

### 3. Configure Storage Policies

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload their profile images
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own profile images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'profile-images' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow public read access to profile images
CREATE POLICY "Public can view profile images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'profile-images');

-- Similar policies for other buckets...
```

### 4. Set up Authentication

```sql
-- Configure auth settings in Supabase dashboard:
-- 1. Enable email signup
-- 2. Configure social providers (Kakao, Apple, Google)
-- 3. Set up phone authentication
-- 4. Configure JWT settings
```

## üöÄ Key Features Implementation

### 1. User Registration & Referral System

```sql
-- Automatic referral code generation on user creation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_user_referral_code()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF NEW.referral_code IS NULL THEN
        NEW.referral_code := generate_referral_code();
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER generate_referral_code_trigger
    BEFORE INSERT ON public.users
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION generate_user_referral_code();
```

### 2. Location-Based Shop Search

```sql
-- Find shops within radius (using PostGIS)
SELECT s.*, 
       ST_Distance(location, ST_MakePoint($longitude, $latitude)::geography) as distance
FROM public.shops s
WHERE ST_DWithin(location, ST_MakePoint($longitude, $latitude)::geography, $radius_in_meters)
  AND shop_status = 'active'
ORDER BY 
  CASE WHEN shop_type = 'partnered' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,
  partnership_started_at DESC,
  distance;
```

### 3. Points System Logic

```sql
-- Award points after service completion
SELECT award_service_points('reservation-uuid-here');

-- Check available points for user
SELECT SUM(amount) as available_points
FROM public.point_transactions
WHERE user_id = $user_id
  AND status = 'available'
  AND (available_from IS NULL OR available_from <= NOW())
  AND (expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > NOW());
```

### 4. Influencer Status Automation

```sql
-- Check and update influencer status
SELECT check_influencer_status('user-uuid-here');
```

## üì± Mobile App Integration

### Authentication Flow
1. **Social Login**: Use Supabase Auth with configured providers
2. **Phone Verification**: Store verification codes in `user_verifications` table
3. **Profile Completion**: Update `users` table with additional info
4. **Referral Processing**: Link referred users via `referred_by_code`

### Push Notifications
1. **Token Management**: Store FCM/APNs tokens in `push_tokens` table
2. **Notification Creation**: Insert into `notifications` table
3. **Delivery Tracking**: Update `sent_at` and `read_at` timestamps

### Real-time Features
1. **Reservation Updates**: Use Supabase real-time subscriptions
2. **New Posts**: Subscribe to `posts` table changes
3. **Notifications**: Real-time notification delivery

## üîê Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All tables have RLS enabled with appropriate policies
- Users can only access their own data
- Shop owners can manage their shop data
- Public data (shops, reviews) is accessible to all authenticated users

### Data Privacy
- Personal information is protected by RLS
- Phone numbers and emails are handled securely
- Business documents are stored in private buckets

### API Security
- Use Supabase service role key for admin operations
- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
- Validate all user inputs on the client side

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring

### User Analytics
- Track user sessions in `user_sessions` table
- Monitor app usage patterns
- Analyze user engagement metrics

### Business Analytics
- Shop performance tracking via `shop_performance_summary` view
- Revenue and booking analytics
- Point system usage monitoring

### System Health
- Monitor failed payments
- Track user complaints and reports
- Analyze system performance metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance & Operations

### Regular Tasks
1. **Point Expiration**: Set up cron job to expire old points
2. **Influencer Status**: Periodically check and update influencer qualifications
3. **Analytics Updates**: Refresh materialized views for performance
4. **Cleanup**: Remove old sessions and expired verification codes

### Backup Strategy
1. **Daily Backups**: Automated database backups
2. **Storage Backups**: Regular file storage backups
3. **Point-in-time Recovery**: Enable for critical data recovery

### Scaling Considerations
1. **Database Indexing**: Monitor and optimize query performance
2. **Connection Pooling**: Use pgBouncer for connection management
3. **Read Replicas**: Consider for heavy read workloads
4. **Caching**: Implement Redis for frequently accessed data

## üìã Migration and Deployment

### Development Environment
```bash
# Set up local development with Supabase CLI
supabase init
supabase db start
supabase db reset --with-seed
```

### Production Deployment
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure production Supabase project
2. **Migration Execution**: Run database structure script
3. **Data Seeding**: Add initial data (admin user, FAQs, etc.)
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all features
5. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts and monitoring

### Data Migration (if from existing system)
1. **User Data**: Migrate existing user accounts
2. **Shop Data**: Import shop listings and services
3. **Transaction History**: Preserve booking and payment records
4. **Content Migration**: Transfer reviews and posts

## üîÑ API Integration Points

### Toss Payments Integration
